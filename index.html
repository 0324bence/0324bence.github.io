                                I was first introduced to website building in elentary school and I have been creating

                                Vue was the first front-end framework I tried, and I was amazed by it's capabilites.

                                The javascript canvas has been a useful tool in my repertoire since I made my first

                                I learned node.js when i made my first discord bot. I have since made multiple bots and

                                Python was one of the first languages I learned extensively. It was taught to us in
