                                I was first introduced to website building in elentary school and I have been creating

                                Vue was the first front-end framework I tried, and I was amazed by it's capabilites.

                                The javascript canvas has been a useful tool in my repertoire since I made my first

                                Python was one of the first languages I learned extensively. It was taught to us in

                        <p>
                            I am Bence Deli, a Software developer student in Hungary looking for my first job. I have
                            been creating websites since Elementary School, and have been programming since I started
                            High School.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I always had a head for problem solving, so programming came easily at first, but I since
                            learned, that there is no limit to knowlage. If you think you know everything you just
                            haven't found the next steps yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I find learning new things easy, especially when they interest me. I am always looking for
                            new technologies and practices to try out and more often then not stick with them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I always make sure to use a version control system for my projects such as git and github.
